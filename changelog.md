# B4 - Bye Bye Big Bro

## [1.1x.x] - 2025-11-xx

-IMPROVED: Enhance `flowState` struct to track `SNI` detection and processing status.

## [1.10.1] - 2025-11-03

- IMPROVED: Intermittent connection failures where blocked sites would randomly fail to load in certain browsers (`Safari`, `Firefox`, `Chrome`). Connections _should_ now be more stable and reliable across all browsers by optimizing packet fragmentation strategy.

## [1.10.0] - 2025-11-02

- ADDED: Automatic `iptables`/`nftables` rules restoration. B4 now automatically detects this and restores itself without requiring a manual restart.
- ADDED: New `--tables-monitor-interval` setting to control how often B4 checks if its rules are still active (default: `10` seconds). Set to `0` to disable automatic monitoring.

- ADDED: `nftables` support.
- CHANGED: `--skip-iptables` and `--clear-iptables` renamed to `--skip-tables` and `--clear-tables`.
